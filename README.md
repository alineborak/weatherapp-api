WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

Create a weather app similar to google weather.

1. Include the JavaScript file provided in your project, when loading your project, ask the user "Enter a city" (example: Paris), alert "It is currently 19°C (66°F) in Paris with a humidity of 80%"

👨‍🏫 Task
In your project, when a user searches for a city (example: New York), it should display the name of the city on the result page and the current temperature of the city.

🙀 Bonus point:
Add a Current Location button. When clicking on it, it uses the Geolocation API to get your GPS coordinates and display and the city and current temperature using the OpenWeather API.
